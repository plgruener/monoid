#Guide

###Stylistic Alternates
The font contains more alternates than available on the webpage - see [StylisticAlternates.fea](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid/blob/master/Utilities/StylisticAlternates.fea) for details. You can access these using `font-feature-settings` in your code editor stylesheet.

###Editor Support (ligatures)
I'm using opentype features `calt` + `liga` to create the ligatures. These are unfortunately not supported by all editors. You need to use the "Ligatures: Off" version if you're experiencing problems related to the ligatures.
#####Confirmed working
* Atom - Mac, Win, Linux
* Eclipse - all platforms
* gEdit - Linux
* LibreOffice Writer (yes, no editor, but support for ligatures) - Linux
* xCode - Mac

#####Not working
* Gnome Terminal - Linux
* gVim - Linux

#####Tips
* Atom Editor [Stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/larsenwork/255432b5101093fb07bc)

## Installation Instructions
Download the desired variant of Monoid from its [website](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/).

### Linux
Copy the .ttf files in your fonts-directory, either
- `~/.local/share/fonts/truetype` (only for local user) or
- `/usr/local/share/fonts/truetype` (global for all users, need to be root). 

(These may differ depending on your distro).
Then you may have to run `sudo fc-cache` to make new fonts available without re-login.

Alternative method: if you've installed some font-viewer (e.g. gnome-font-viewer for gnome, or the built-in tool in kde), you may try to simply double-click the .ttf file and hit `install`.

*Note: currently only tested with Ubuntu/Linux, please inform if it's not working for you.*
### Mac OS X

### Windows

#####PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
